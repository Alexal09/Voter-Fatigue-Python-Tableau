# Voter-Fatigue-Python-Tableau

This project was the last of the Data Analytics course at Career Foundry.

the objective was to find an open source data set to build an interactive dashboard that will showcase results of advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

Data set:

can be found here: https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/voter-turnout

or in the documents attached to this repository.

It was sourced from IDEA. It stands for The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. They are an organization government by its 35 member states, which Canada chairs. Their primary source are the national electoral management bodies and national statistical bureaus of the respective countries. The data is either taken from source's website or official reports. If the data is not available, their secondary source are the country's census reports. Since the data comes from official country sources it is trustworthy.

The goal of this analysis is to find out if we are experiencing global voter fatigue through:
- Exploratory analysis through visualizations (scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots
and categorical plots)
- Geospatial analysis using a shapefile
- Regression analysis through supervised machine learning
- Cluster analysis through unsupervised machine learning
- Time-series analysis
